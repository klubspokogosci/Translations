<color=#EC2121>SCP-079</color> has no direct combat or movement capabilities. Instead, you view and interact with the world through security cameras found in every room. All available abilities are listed in the top-right corner of your HUD.
Virtually Indestructible:There are three generators in Heavy Containment Zone. If all are engaged, you can be recontained from your chamber. Generators have a countdown sequence that can be interrupted by pressing the "CANCEL" button on the generator.
Unlimited Access:You can manipulate numerous systems in the facility to assist the other <color=#d60202>SCPs</color>. The top right of your screen shows what abilities are available. These abilities cost auxiliary power (AP) to use, which regenerates over time. 
Deep Learning:Assisting in terminations, or performing helpful actions for the other <color=#d60202>SCPs</color> will grant you experience towards a new access tier. Each new tier provides more AP, and grants you new abilities.
Overwatch:Being everywhere and nowhere grants you a unique perspective. You can ping locations, people, and objects of interest, allowing you to assist in the slaughter.
